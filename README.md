# Neon Letters - Talk is cheap, show me the code!


---

## Description

Neon Letters project was developed to study the animation effect that simulates the gloss and flicker effect of a real sign, mostly used in bars, restaurants, barbershops, etc.

Through the @keyframes properties in CSS, I was able to realize this study exercise and create the wanted effect solution.
